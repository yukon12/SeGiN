### SeGiN
SeGiN is a library written in C. It's supposed to provide implementations of various algorithms and data structures.  
  
This is just my personal project. Its basic purpose is to help me learn about algorithms and data structures as well as coding in C. If you find any bugs or have suggestions on how to improve the code, feel free to open an issue or pull a request.
